<h1>Ticket Resolutions: CFO Laptop Ticket ðŸªŸ</h1>
This section outlines a hypothetical scenario in which our End-User Karen Doe has submitted a ticket for her CFO because his laptop will not switch on. I have structured this section the same way as the last so we can see the Ticket Thread as a series of events, including changing the properties of the Ticket in the beginning to the conversation thread with the End-User to the solution of the ticket.
<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Lenovo Ideapad 5 Pro 16gb AMD Ryzen 7
- Microsoft Azure Resource Group
- Microsoft Azure Windows 10 Pro version 22H2 - x64 Gen2 Virtual Machine
- osTicket Software and File Dependencies

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Local Windows 11 Home Version 21H2</b>
- Windows 10 Pro version 22H2 Virtual Machine
  
<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Subscription
- Microsoft Azure Subscription Credit 

<h2>Installation, Setup, Resource Setup, Executing Functions</h2>

1. Below I have created a ticket as our End-User Karen Doe. The main features of the ticket we can observe before changing a couple of features are the priority level which is high due to the urgency of the issue as the CFOs laptop is essential for them to undertake their tasks for the business. It is assigned to John Doe in the support department and has a default SLA Plan of 18 hours. The End-User Karen has stated "adobe software not working for employees in the accounting department."

    My first actions as seen in the ticket thread were to update the priority level of the ticket from "Normal" to "High". I then claimed the ticket as John Doe Agent and updated the SLA Plan from the Default Plan to the Sev B Plan which has a grace period of 4 hours to allow for sufficient troubleshooting.

    I then began the process of troubleshooting with the End-User by querying whether they had any indications that power was running through the machine. The End-User then replied stating that the machine wasn't showing any indications of having power but that the battery was recently fully charged.

2. At this stage I am confirming with the End-User that the issue not being caused by the battery and instead we should do a hard reset on the machine. I advise the End-User of this and confirm that they are ready to proceed.

  Once they confirm, I guide them through the hard reset, advising them to hold down the power button for 15 seconds and allow it to fully boot after this. The End-User confirms this has remedied the problem and it is now switching on.

  I would add that in a live setting I would also normally ask the End-User to confirm that the system is running smoothly after the hard reset and if not, then I would advise the End-User on how to troubleshoot the issue by booting the machine in safe-mode or recovery-mode, and if necessary, making sure the latest BIOS version is installed.

  I then proceed to confirm closure of the ticket with the End-User.
